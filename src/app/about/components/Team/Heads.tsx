            "In my sophomore year, I joined the FTC robotics team 479, feeling a mix of excitement and nerves. The world of robotics and engineering was new to me, and I was unsure of how I would fit in. However, as I spent more time with the team, I quickly became immersed in the technical challenges and collaborative environment. I developed a passion for engineering, learning new skills and concepts along the way. The support from my teammates helped me grow more confident, and I found myself contributing actively to the team's projects, gaining valuable experience in the process.",

            "I joined Stuy Fusion a little late, as a sophomore, unsure of where I could contribute. Determined to help out, I quickly immersed myself in learning FTC software and discovered my passion for programming and problem-solving. Being part of Stuy Fusion has sharpened my technical skills and taught me the value of collaboration and perseverance. Outside of robotics, I enjoy playing video games and swimming, both of which help me unwind and stay motivated in everything I do.",

            "I joined the team as a sophomore with zero prior experience but a strong interest in STEM. Although I was reserved at first, Iâ€™ve become a much more confident communicator by participating in and leading outreach initiatives. As Head of Marketing, I'm excited to continue improving myself while giving back to the community and inspiring younger generations to explore STEM. Outside of robotics, I enjoy trying new restaurants with friends, drawing, and watching TV."
