        <h1>New Website</h1>
        <p>
            We have redesigned our website for the 2022-23 season, adding new sections to view team news and also to sponsor us.

        <h1>Summer Recap</h1>
        <p>
            To practice for the upcoming season, we met over the summer to build a bot for our game BallBusters.

        <h1>Newbies</h1>
        <p>
            After a successful interest meeting with our school’s sister teams Stuy Fission 310 and FRC 694, we have around 10 newbies this year. We have been giving intensive newbie ed lessons on CAD, software engineering, and engineering/design. These lessons have been successful and the newbies are largely capable.

        <h1>Looking Forward</h1>
        <p>
            The season has started off slowly, but we are ramping up and plan to finish our robot in the two coming weeks. With less than a month before our first qualifier on 12/3, the pressure is on and the team is getting busy. We have also moved into the newly renovated robotics lab in our school, providing us with space, new tools, and deeper integration with our school’s other teams.
